# Design and Implementation of Any Time Electricity Bill Payment (ATP) Machine Controller

This project was developed during the Intel Uanatti internship program. The goal of the project was to design and implement a controller for an Any Time Electricity Bill Payment (ATP) machine. The controller is written in Verilog and uses the Intel Quartus Prime software.

## Features

The ATP machine controller has the following features:

* Accepts credit card payments for electricity bills
* Generates a receipt for the payment
* Logs all transactions
* Communicates with a back-end database

## Mentors

* Academic mentor: Ms. Chithra R.
* Industry mentor: Abhishek Nandy

## Team members

* Sathiyaseelan
* Sarvesh Kumar

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank our mentors for their guidance and support. We would also like to thank our team members for their hard work and dedication.

## To use

To use the ATP machine controller, you will need to have the Intel Quartus Prime software installed. You can then download the source code from this GitHub repo and compile it using the Quartus Prime software. Once the code is compiled, you can load it onto the ATP machine controller hardware.
